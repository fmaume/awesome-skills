"""Revalidate the whole skill catalog against the live world (L5).

Where scripts/lint_references.py gates a single PR, this script sweeps *all*
skills periodically and reports rot that appeared after merge: actors that got
deprecated, made private or deleted, author pages that vanished, external links
that died.

Classification is reused from lint_references (valid_actor_id, store-url
folding, fence handling), so the two tools agree on what an Actor id *is*. The
scope is deliberately wider than the PR gate's, because rot does not respect the
directory layout the gate happens to walk:

  - every *.md file under a skill directory is swept (SKILL.md, references/,
    reference/, examples/, REGISTRATION/, data/, commands/, AGENTS.md, ...),
    not just SKILL.md + references/
  - plugin bundles that ship their own nested skills
    (skills/<bundle>/skills/<child>/) are swept as skills in their own right and
    reported under "<bundle>/<child>"
  - an Actor id written as a bare code span in prose (`owner/name`) counts as a
    reference, not only ids in routing tables, CLI commands and store URLs

Only the checks and the reporting differ from the gate:

  - every finding is a WARNING; the exit code is always 0
  - the output is a report (machine JSON + markdown for a GitHub issue),
    never a gate

Checks
  actor-id / store-url  existence, isPublic, isDeprecated via the public,
                        unauthenticated Apify API (lint_references.fetch_actor_status)
  author_url            liveness of the frontmatter author page
  external-url          liveness of non-Apify links used in prose
                        (URLs that only appear inside fenced code blocks are
                        sample payloads, not links — they are not checked)

Not checked here, on purpose: whether a SKILL.md *declares* an author_url at
all, and whether it declares it as a top-level frontmatter key (a skill that
nests `author_url:` under `metadata:` has no author for any tool that reads the
frontmatter flat). Those are structural defects of a single skill, catchable
before merge, and they belong to the PR-time gate (scripts/lint_references.py,
the validate-pr workflow), not to a weekly sweep of the live world. So the hole
is not silent, every run reports how many skills carry no checkable author_url
and names them in the JSON under `checked.author_urls_skipped`.

Placeholder-looking URLs (example.com, .../idNUMBER, https://…) are skipped, and
anything the network refuses to answer for (403/429/5xx/timeouts) is reported as
"unverifiable", not as a finding — a weekly report must not cry wolf.

Findings are one per unique subject (Actor id / URL), with every affected skill
and every location listed on that row: one dead author page shared by two skills
is one fix to make and one row to read, not two.

Authors are attributed from the `author_url` frontmatter field. Handles are
rendered in backticks by default; --mention-authors switches to live @mentions
(only ever use that on a repo where pinging those people is intended).

Usage:
  uv run scripts/revalidate_catalog.py                        # full catalog, markdown to stdout
  uv run scripts/revalidate_catalog.py --json-out report.json --markdown-out report.md
  uv run scripts/revalidate_catalog.py skills/apify-ecommerce  # subset, for debugging
  uv run scripts/revalidate_catalog.py --skip-external         # actors only (fast)
