# The diagnostic run: input, output, and the fields that answer Step 2

`SKILL.md` says what to look at. This file is the ready-made run that produces it, plus the places the platform hides something you will need.

## Start with the small input, not the big one

Through the MCP server this whole object is the `input` argument to `call-actor` with `actor: "apify/cheerio-scraper"`; through the CLI it is `diagnose.json`. Either way, **start here**: this object validates as it stands, measured on the first attempt, escaped `pageFunction` and hook included. Start from it and add one field at a time, because when a larger input is rejected the message is `Validation errors: must be object`, it names no field, and its wording points at the wrong thing entirely, see the note under the full input:

```json
{
  "startUrls": [{ "url": "https://example.com/" }],
  "proxyConfiguration": { "useApifyProxy": true },
  "maxRequestRetries": 0,
  "maxConcurrency": 1,
  "preNavigationHooks": "[async ({ session }) => { if (session) { const retire = session.retireOnBlockedStatusCodes.bind(session); session.retireOnBlockedStatusCodes = (code, extra) => { retire(code, extra); return false; }; } }]",
  "pageFunction": "async function pageFunction(context) { const r = context.response || {}; const h = r.headers || {}; const body = String(context.body || ''); const $ = typeof context.$ === 'function' ? context.$ : null; return { url: context.request.url, loadedUrl: context.request.loadedUrl, status: r.status, cfMitigated: h['cf-mitigated'], bytes: body.length, title: $ ? $('title').text().trim().slice(0, 80) : null }; }"
}
```

Six fields answer the first two rows of Step 2, which is where most investigations end. Grow to the full version below only when the answer is a `200` and you have to tell a shell from a brochure.

**If your target serves JSON rather than HTML, you need nothing extra** — `application/json` and `application/xml` are among the Actor's default content types alongside the HTML ones, measured identical with and without `additionalMimeTypes`. The field is only for a type outside that list, such as `text/plain` or CSV. **When you do need it, through MCP it is rejected in every encoding measured**: an array gives `Validation errors: must be object`, the array as a JSON string gives the same, an object gives `must be array`, and the build schema declares it an array. Everything else here validates alongside it, so when a run is rejected, this is the field to pull first. Workarounds are in Rung 4 of `SKILL.md`: run it from the CLI, ask the service for an HTML representation, or fetch the endpoint with your own code.

**Through MCP, `proxyConfiguration` is required** and its absence is reported as `Validation errors: must have required property 'proxyConfiguration'` buried in a reply that opens by printing the entire input schema. Through the CLI the same input runs without it. If an MCP call is rejected and you cannot see why, check this before you start bisecting your `pageFunction`.

## The full input

The `preNavigationHooks` line is the one from `SKILL.md`, and without it every refusal arrives as an empty item.

```json
{
  "startUrls": [{ "url": "https://example.com/" }],
  "proxyConfiguration": { "useApifyProxy": true },
  "maxRequestRetries": 0,
  "maxConcurrency": 1,
  "preNavigationHooks": "[async ({ session }) => { if (session) { const retire = session.retireOnBlockedStatusCodes.bind(session); session.retireOnBlockedStatusCodes = (code, extra) => { retire(code, extra); return false; }; } }]",
  "pageFunction": "async function pageFunction(context) { const $ = typeof context.$ === 'function' ? context.$ : null; const r = context.response || {}; const h = r.headers || {}; const host = new URL(context.request.url).hostname; const links = $ ? $('a[href^=\"http\"]').map((i, el) => { try { return new URL($(el).attr('href')).hostname; } catch (e) { return null; } }).get().filter(Boolean) : []; const offHost = links.filter(x => x !== host); const tally = {}; offHost.forEach(x => { tally[x] = (tally[x] || 0) + 1; }); const topOffHost = Object.entries(tally).sort((a, b) => b[1] - a[1]).slice(0, 5); return { url: context.request.url, loadedUrl: context.request.loadedUrl, status: r.status, cfMitigated: h['cf-mitigated'], etag: h.etag, server: h.server, via: h.via, cfRay: h['cf-ray'], xCache: h['x-cache'], retryAfter: h['retry-after'], setCookie: h['set-cookie'] ? String(h['set-cookie']).slice(0, 200) : null, contentType: h['content-type'], bytes: context.body ? context.body.length : 0, title: $ ? $('title').text().trim().slice(0, 80) : null, mountPoints: $ ? $('#root, #app, #vue-app, [id^=\"__next\"]').length : null, scripts: $ ? $('script[src]').length : null, offHostLinks: offHost.length, topOffHost: topOffHost, bodyHead: String(context.body || '').replace(/\\s+/g, ' ').slice(0, 300) }; }"
}
```

Which field decides what:

- `status` and `cfMitigated` separate a hard block from a managed challenge, the first two rows of Step 2.
- `etag` and `bytes` run the shell test: an SPA shell returns the same bytes and the same `ETag` for two different record ids.
- `offHostLinks` and `topOffHost` separate a shell from a brochure.
- `bodyHead` catches meta-refresh stubs, stock server pages and soft 404s without a second request.
- `loadedUrl` catches the site that moved. Compare it with `url` every time.

**To measure a rate rather than an outcome**, repeat one URL in `startUrls` with distinct `uniqueKey` values. Six entries, one run, six independent proxy draws, sub-cent.

## The response object is not the raw client's

In `apify/cheerio-scraper` the `response` handed to a `pageFunction` carries exactly two keys, `status` and `headers`. There is no `statusCode`; asking for one returns undefined rather than throwing, which is how it goes silently missing from a diagnostic. The browser Actors hand you the same shape, so `response.status()` throws there instead of returning a number.

The platform also writes its own view into every dataset item: `#debug.statusCode`, `#debug.retryCount`, `#debug.errorMessages` and `#debug.loadedUrl`. When an item arrives with `#error: true` and nothing else, `#debug.errorMessages` is the only thing that says what happened.

## Reading the reply, whichever interface you are on

| What you want | MCP | CLI |
|---|---|---|
| the dataset to read | `storages.datasets.default.id` | `storage.defaultDatasetId` |
| the store holding run counters | `storages.keyValueStores.default.id` | `storage.defaultKeyValueStoreId` |
| the items | `get-dataset-items` with that id | `apify datasets get-items <id> --format json` |

**The item count in that reply undercounts**, because it is read while the run is still flushing. Measured three times in one afternoon: a reply reporting one item belonged to a dataset holding six, and another reporting four belonged to one holding six. Read the dataset before concluding anything about how many items a run produced.

## Getting the input schema, which is not where you would expect

`apify actors info <actor> --input --json` returns the Actor record, with the schema nested inside it as an escaped string under `taggedBuilds.<tag>.build.inputSchema`, so grepping that output for a field name finds nothing. The direct route works from either interface and returns it as JSON:

```bash
curl -s "https://api.apify.com/v2/acts/apify~cheerio-scraper/builds/default" \
  | python -c "import json,sys; print(sorted(json.load(sys.stdin)['data']['actorDefinition']['input']['properties']))"
```

## Where the request counters actually live

They are not in the call reply and not in `apify runs info`, whose `stats` holds duration, compute units and memory only. Take the key-value store id (see the table above) and read:

```bash
curl -s "https://api.apify.com/v2/key-value-stores/KV_STORE_ID/records/SDK_CRAWLER_STATISTICS_0"
```

`requestsFinished`, `requestsFailed` and `requestsRetries` are in there, and so is `requestsWithStatusCode`, a histogram naming the status codes the run actually received. A run can finish `SUCCEEDED` with `exitCode 0` while some requests failed, so read this before concluding anything from a short dataset. Once the hook above is in place the dataset itself answers most of these questions, and the counters are the cross-check rather than the source.

## What the un-blinding hook is worth, measured

Six identical requests to one challenged vendor platform, one run each, same proxy pool, `PER_REQUEST` rotation:

| Hook | Items carrying fields | Refusals classified | Requests that got through |
|---|---|---|---|
| none | 3 of 6 | 0, three empty error items | 3 |
| retire and return false | **6 of 6** | **2, both `cf-mitigated: challenge`** | 4 |
| never retire | 6 of 6 | 6 | **0** |

Read the middle column, not the first: without the hook the run classified **nothing**, and the three items that carried fields were the requests that succeeded, not refusals it managed to read.

`gotOptions.throwHttpErrors = false` is deliberately absent from that table. It is the setting people reach for, and it cannot be tested this way at all: `gotOptions` is not among the Actor's 30 input fields, and an input containing it is accepted without a validation error and then silently discarded. A run with it is indistinguishable from a run without it — measured on a target returning `403` to every request, both produced six items whose entire field list was `#error` and `#debug.*`, with the same `errorMessages` and the same `requestsFailed: 6`. Crawlee is not throwing because got threw; it is throwing because the session pool treats 401, 403 and 429 as blocking, and no input field on this Actor reaches that behaviour.

Dropping the retire call unblinds the run and costs every request that would have succeeded, because the pool stops rotating away from addresses the site has already refused. That is the last row of the table: everything classified, nothing delivered.

**Take the hook out once the refusal is classified.** Left in, a crawl writes challenge pages into the dataset as if they were records.
