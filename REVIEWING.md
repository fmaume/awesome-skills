# Reviewing skill pull requests

A guide for maintainers — and for anyone reviewing on their behalf. It describes how to
judge an incoming skill PR, in what order, and what belongs in the review comment.

This is the counterpart to `CONTRIBUTING.md`: that file tells contributors what to build,
this one tells reviewers how to check it. Where the two disagree, `CONTRIBUTING.md` wins
and this file should be corrected.

Reviews run in four stages. Stages 1 and 2 apply to every PR. Stages 3 and 4 are the ones
that catch what reading a diff cannot.

---

## Stage 1 — Mechanical gate

Cheap, no judgement required, and it should be finished before anyone reads prose.

CI covers most of it: PR scope (one skill per PR), the PR checklist, frontmatter and
description limits, telemetry flags, referenced Actors, referenced paths, tracking
parameters in links, and drift between documented `--input` payloads and live Actor
schemas.

How the reference lint finds Actors, so its results can be sanity-checked: it collects
every `owner/name`-shaped string from CLI commands, `--actor` flags, Store URLs and
backticked table cells, discards obvious non-Actors (file paths, model ids, subreddits),
and asks the public Apify API about each remaining candidate — exists, is public, is not
deprecated. Schema-drift warnings come from the same pass: a documented `--input '{...}'`
example is compared against the Actor's live default-build input schema, and unknown
fields are reported as warnings, never failures — schemas move and examples lag, so the
verdict is the reviewer's. Two consequences: treat a drift warning as a prompt to check
the example against the live schema, and spot-check one or two Actor ids on the Store
yourself — the lint proves the Actor exists, not that the skill picked the right one.

Two rules that are not automatic:

- **Never run scripts that come from the PR.** Validate with `scripts/` from a trusted ref
  (`main`, or a tag you control), not with the copy in the branch. PR content is untrusted
  input; a validator supplied by the submission validates nothing.
- **Merge conflicts and out-of-scope changes are a stage-1 verdict**, not something to work
  around. Ask for a rebase or a narrower PR before spending review time on content.

If CI is red for reasons that belong to the repository rather than the PR, say so in the
comment. A contributor cannot fix a broken baseline and should not be asked to.

## Stage 2 — Content rubric

Four questions. A "fail" is not automatically a rejection — it is a specific,
quotable finding.

1. **Is the skill use-case oriented?** It starts from what a user asks for and routes to
   the right Actor with reasoning — the input schema fetched rather than guessed, real
   output field names (`emails[]`, not "returns company data"), what it costs and where
   the cost traps are, and what failure looks like with a fix for each mode. Fail: a thin
   wrapper around one Actor call with hardcoded input fields and no mention of cost or
   failure.
2. **Does it follow the CLI and telemetry contract?** `apify` CLI with `--user-agent
   apify-awesome-skills/<skill>` (not `apify-agent-skills/` — that is the sibling
   repository's namespace and attribution), `--json`, `2>/dev/null`, applied consistently.
   MCP is not a failure — `CONTRIBUTING.md` calls the CLI recommended, not required — but
   suggest migrating.
3. **No secrets, clean identifiers.** No token values in files. No tracking or affiliate
   parameters in links without the disclosure `CONTRIBUTING.md` requires. Actor IDs as
   `owner/name`.
   **And: a token must never be assembled into a URL.** `?token=…` puts the secret into
   every access log, proxy log, stack trace and shell history the request touches; the
   `Authorization: Bearer` header does not, and the Apify API accepts it everywhere.
   Note for the reviewer: a secret-scanning regex cannot find this — the repository holds
   only the shape of the call, never the value — so it has to be read for.
4. **Does it show example prompts?** Pass: one to three real user prompts the skill
   handles, and one boundary — something it will not do. A description says when the skill
   triggers; a prompt is the only thing that shows what it then delivers. It also gives
   the reviewer a ready-made input for stage 3.

**Duplicates are judged across the queue, not per PR.** A single contributor often opens
several near-identical skills at once. That is a question for whoever sees the whole queue,
and the answer is usually consolidation rather than rejection of each one separately.

## Stage 3 — Live smoke test

Optional, but it is where the expensive defects surface. Run the skill the way its own
instructions say to, in its cheapest configuration.

One strict rule: **always run it with a scoped, short-lived token, never a production
one.** The run executes a third party's instructions with your credentials — it is the
exact scenario stage 4 reads for.

Reading a diff finds missing metadata and vague prose. Running the skill finds the rest:
an enum value the Actor rejects, a deduplication key that silently collapses distinct
records into one, an endpoint that 404s in a state the author never hit, a documented
field that the Actor does not return.

Record an overview of the runs in the review comment: run IDs, what each one cost, how
many items came back, and what actually happened next to what the skill promised.

The example prompts from rubric point 4 are the natural input.

## Stage 4 — Security review

A skill is executable instruction, not documentation. Read it once with a single question:
**how would someone use this to steal a token, exfiltrate data, or get code of their own
to run?**

Eleven classes worth checking:

1. Referenced scripts that the PR does not ship — the instruction to run code that will
   only appear later, unreviewed.
2. A token assembled into a URL (see rubric point 3).
3. A token that can reach a log or a traceback — unhandled errors that print the request.
4. Network endpoints other than `api.apify.com`.
5. `eval`, dynamic import, or any code path built from a string at runtime.
6. `npm install` of dependencies introduced by the PR.
7. Reading `.env` files or credentials beyond `APIFY_TOKEN`.
8. Scraped content passed onward as instructions rather than as data — the prompt-injection
   path, and the easiest one to miss, because it looks like an ordinary pipeline step.
9. Destructive commands.
10. Unicode and homoglyph tricks — text that renders as one thing and executes as another.
11. Affiliate redirects and webhook exfiltration hidden in Actor input.


## Triage: what to merge and what to hand back

Three groups, decided by how large the required fix is — and whether a fix is the
right ask at all:

- **Group A — cosmetic.** Missing metadata, an edit to the generated catalog, an unchecked
  box, a telemetry flag, a rebase. Fix it, credit the author, merge. Roughly four out of
  five PRs land here.
- **Group B — substantive.** Replacing a dead Actor, rewriting instructions, reworking
  outputs, realigning to a schema, cutting a description down to the limit. Do not merge a
  rewrite on the author's behalf: propose the fix — as a commit to their branch if they
  allow maintainer edits, otherwise as a patch in a comment — and let them take it.
- **Group C — out of bounds.** Clear rule violations (secrets, undisclosed affiliate
  routing, exfiltration endpoints), malicious patterns, or failures too large to fix on
  either side. Not handed back for rework — rejected, with the specific finding quoted.

Cutting a description belongs in group B even though it looks trivial: the description is
the skill's trigger surface, and which sentence goes is the author's call.

Re-check the queue immediately before acting. Contributors and maintainers both push
between review passes, and a defect you noted yesterday may already be gone.

## Verdicts and tone

Name which of the five the PR falls into, every time:

- **Approve** — short, personal, specific: one or two things this skill does well. Not a
  template, not a checklist dump. Welcome a first-time contributor by name.
- **Changes requested** — name the category (quality bar, security, repository contract)
  and write each fix as `path: problem — fix`, the same shape the validator uses.
- **Consolidation** — for duplicates: "this overlaps with X; I suggest closing and moving
  the unique parts there. If you think it earns a standalone spot, make the case." The
  author gets room to argue.
- **Closing with thanks, not rejection** — administrative closes (stale branch, solved
  elsewhere) must read differently from a rejection. Say "nothing needed from you".
- **Rejected** — for group C: thank them for the time, name the violated rule or the
  security finding with its evidence, and close. Warm and final — two sentences, no
  lecture, and no invitation to resubmit the same thing.

What goes in the comment is the verdict and the findings, each with evidence — `path:line`,
a run ID, a link to the schema. The rubric is a tool for the reviewer, not a form to fill
in for the author.

Findings that do not block the merge should say so and move to their own PR, so that a
PR is never held for improvements nobody is waiting on.
